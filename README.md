# 🚗 SUV Car Classification with Teachable Machine 🏆
Welcome to the SUV Car Classification Project! This repository showcases a machine learning model built using Teachable Machine to classify seven different SUV models from the year 2012. 🎯

# 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project consists of images of seven distinct SUV models from the year 2012. These are:

* Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV 2012 🛻
* Dodge Durango SUV 2012 🚙
* Land Rover Range Rover SUV 2012 🌍
* Jeep Wrangler SUV 2012 🏞️
* Cadillac SRX SUV 2012 🚗 
* GMC Terrain SUV 2012 🚘 

# 📈 Model Training & Testing
🛠️ __Training__
The model was trained using Teachable Machine, an easy-to-use tool by Google for creating machine learning models without requiring deep technical knowledge.

Data Collection: Images of the seven SUV models were collected and labeled.
Model Training: Images were used to train a classification model to recognize and differentiate between the SUV models.

__🧪 Testing__
The trained model was then tested to ensure accurate classification of the vehicles. Results were highly accurate, demonstrating the effectiveness of the training process.
